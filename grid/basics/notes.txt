Grid -> Is a possible value for the property display and is used to create layout pages, like flexbox
the element with display Grid value we become the container to a grid container and the direct sons 
of that element to grid elements.

Take in account that this represent a way to make a grid or something like visually works like a table.

Basic concepts: Taking in account that the base elements for it are columns and rows we have, also
have cells, column lines and row lines.

Like in flexbox there are several properties that works with grid:
grid-template-rows: Accept several web measure values that represent the height of the cells, when add a new 
                   value a new row is going to be added.
grid-template-columns: Works similar to rows but it represent the width and number of columns to add.
gap: It is a short-hand of column gap and row gap and represent the value of distance between the one cell
     and the other close cells.

Taking in account that a cell have row and column lines, we are able to increment the size of a cell
taking as reference the row and column lines or another cell, it works like join cells in excel, but
with difference that the cell that is currently using that place is going to be reallocated, to do that 
our currently grid need to have empty cells. For do that grid provide a couple of properties.

grid-column: It is shorthand of grid-column-starts and grid-column-ends, and accept two values separated 
by a slash (/) that indicates the current cell is going to update his size, the provided values 
represents where the cells starts and where ends, the values correspond to the grid colum lines.


grid-row: It is shorthand of grid-row-starts and grid-row-ends, and accept two values separated 
by a slash (/) that indicates the current cell is going to update his size, the provided values 
represents where the cells starts and where ends, the values correspond to the grid colum lines.
