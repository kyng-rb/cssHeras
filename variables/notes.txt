CSS Variables -> It works in the same way of the variables of any programming language, it represents a 
memory space that allow store a value.

In order to declare it we need to write a double dashes and the variable name, for example --my-variable and for 
read the value of it we need to call the function var() and send as parameter the name of the variable, for 
example var(--my-variable).

It can store a string like color or a composed value like the borders for example --my-variable: solid 1px red.

The value stored can be replaced, the way to do it is the same of declare it, --my-variable: value, take 
in account that the it will affect to only the sons members of the rule that redefined it, working
in the similar way as a cascade.

Taking in account that it works like a cascade is a normal practice declare the variables in the root of the document
using the pseudo-class :root
