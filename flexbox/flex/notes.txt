on the main axis of the items, this is a shorthand of flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis, the default
value to that property is flex: 0 1 auto.

Flex-grow: This property modify the behavior of the item when there is a no used space between the container and 
the set of flex items, it takes an integer value, and sum to the actual with space the result of divide the 
blank space between the grow number. Usually put the value to zero causing that the item takes all the blank space.
Also takes in account that if several items has a flex-grow the formula takes in account the sum of all the 
flex-grow items.

container, it takes a integer as value, by default is 1 for all the elements, it represent a factor for resize the 
item element, when the value for it grows the downgrade with value for the element will increment.
