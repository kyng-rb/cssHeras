About flex: To reach the responsive behavior we can use flex-box, is too important for this
use the wrap value for flex-wrap property, why? use that will cause the elements skips to the 
next line in order to avoid overflow the container.

One time with that we need set the grow and shrink factors to let to the son elements resize with respect 
to the container.

Also is important define the basis factor of the elements, use this in combination with the grow and shrink
is useful because it is going to be the size base for the grow or shrink behavior of the elements. For example 
a set of elements inside a container with width of 1000 if we leave the elements with no basis is going to take
all the with for each element, but if we put the basis to 300 at least 3 elements are going to be placed at the 
wide of the container and when the container resize the elements will modify his size based on the original basis measure.
