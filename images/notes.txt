Images -> There are several errors that are typical on web app development between them
the use of images, on it we are going to check some of them.

Center images
There are several ways to do it, now we are going to check a couple of them.
display as block or inline-block: By default an img tag is inline element it mean
that is going to grow with the image size and the margins are going to not work,
solve that is simple than display the image as block or inline block and 
redefine the horizontal margins to auto.
The other one way to do it is avoid change the display property and put the img tag
inside an container, after did this define the text-align property of the 
container to Center.

Overflow of Images
Is a common issue and is caused by an image too big for the container, remembering the
img tags are inline it is going to grow, the best way to treat with this without 
affect the image look is define the max with of the image to the 100% of the container.

Center image and text
It is common for titles and more, there are two ways to do it.
The first one is defining the container a display table and the elements
as display table cell and vertical align to middle.

The second one and most used is define the display property of the container 
as flex and the align-items property also of the container as Center, this is 
widely used but is not working with some old browsers.
